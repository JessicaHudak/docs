# Safety Overview

:::danger

Always follow corporate guidelines and regional safety regulations. For questions about device-specific safety requirements, refer to the device documentation.

Perform a comprehensive risk assessment for each task in each automation cell. **Not identifying, documenting, and addressing all potential risks and hazards can lead to serious injury or death.**

Some robot arms are made for collaborative applications. Never consider them inherently safe. Only use these "collaborative" robots in accordance with **ISO 10218-2:2012** and **ISO/TS 15066:2016**, and according to your comprehensive risk assessment.
