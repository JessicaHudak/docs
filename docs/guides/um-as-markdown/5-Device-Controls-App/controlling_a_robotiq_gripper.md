To fully open the gripper, tap **OPEN GRIPPER**. To fully close the gripper, tap **CLOSE GRIPPER**.

Choose how far the gripper opens/closes, how fast it opens/closes, and how much force it uses to open/close. Enter values into the **Position**, **Velocity**, and **Force**boxes. Then tap **SET POSITION** to move the gripper with the set parameters.
