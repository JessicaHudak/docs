# License Information

The License Information screen shows the status of your ForgeOS license. If the license is active, the page shows the license code. If itâ€™s your first time booting ForgeOS, you are taken directly to this page to activate ForgeOS.

See [Activating Forge/OS with a License Code](add_forge_license.md) for license activation steps.

See [Deactivating ForgeOS with a License Code](deactivate_forge_license.md) for license deactivation steps.

**Note:** READY can use a web portal to enable a list of applications to appear in the **Licensed Applications** table according to your specific license code. This table will update upon license activation. If a license is already active, the table will update upon license deactivation and reactivation. Once applications appear in the table, sort them by name or expiration date.
