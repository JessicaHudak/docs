# Block Glossary

The types of **blocks** available in Task Canvas depend on the devices you added in Task Settings.

Add blocks to a task from the **Block Menu**. The Block Menu organizes block types by device, except for the Canvas blocks. **Canvas** blocks are not specific to any device. Some of them can control multiple devices and others control flowchart logic or variables.
