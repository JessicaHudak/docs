# Network I/O Device Blocks

Add network-based Fieldbus devices to check and set I/O device states. These blocks work the same as Canvas Check and Set blocks, but the device is filtered to the Fieldbus device.

## Check

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Check*](Canvas-Check.md).

## Set

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Set*](Canvas-Set.md).
