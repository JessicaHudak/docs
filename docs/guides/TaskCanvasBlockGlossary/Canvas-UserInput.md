|**Note:** You can choose **Float, Integer,** and **String** variables in the User Input block. You cannot choose a **Boolean** variable.

When the User Input block is executed, a pop-up prompts you to provide a value for each selected variable.

For each listed variable, choose to keep its **Current** value, **Reset** it to its default value, or **Set** it to another value. Or tap **STOP TASK**.

To add a variable to the table, click **ADD +** and select it from the Variable Selector.
