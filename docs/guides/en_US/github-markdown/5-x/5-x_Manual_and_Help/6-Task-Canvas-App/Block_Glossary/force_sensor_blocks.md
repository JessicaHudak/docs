# Force Sensor Blocks

The Force Sensor blocks include Check and Zero Sensor. The Check block is the same as the Canvas Check block, but the device is filtered to the Force Sensor. See [*Canvas Blocks \> Check*](check_block.md).

**Note:** To use force in a move block, add a force sensor to the robot in Device Configuration, then find the **Force**tab in a move block \(see [Robot Command Blocks](robot_command_blocks.md)\).
