# Network I/O Device Blocks

Add network-based Fieldbus devices to check and set I/O device states. These blocks work the same as Canvas Check and Set blocks, but the device is filtered to the Fieldbus device.

## Check

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Check*](check_block.md).

## Set

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Set*](set_block.md).
