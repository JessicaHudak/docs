# Serial Device Blocks

Add serial Fieldbus devices to check and set I/O device states and sensors. These blocks work the same as Canvas Check and Set blocks, but the device is filtered to the serial device.

## Check

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Check*](check_block.md).

## Set

See [*Canvas Blocks \> Set*](set_block.md).
