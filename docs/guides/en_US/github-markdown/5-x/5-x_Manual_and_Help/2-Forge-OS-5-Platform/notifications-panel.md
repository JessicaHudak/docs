# Notifications Panel

|The Notification Panel displays a table of status history.

|New notifications appear in the unacknowledged list until you acknowledge them.

 Select one or more notifications and tap **View** for more information \(such as fix instructions\).

 To clear the selected notification\(s\) to the acknowledged list, tap **Acknowledge**.

 To clear all unacknowledged notifications at once, select no notifications and tap **Acknowledge All**.
